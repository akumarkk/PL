Reflow
The process of recalculating the size and position of all elements in the document (or a portion of it). This happens whenever anything on the page changes that might affect the layout, such as:

- Adding or removing elements from the DOM
- Resizing the browser window
- Changing font sizes, margins, or padding
- Applying CSS styles that affect layout (e.g., width, height, display, float)
Most expensive operation: Reflows can be computationally expensive, especially on complex pages with many elements.
