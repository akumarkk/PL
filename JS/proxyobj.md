###### Proxy obj
the Proxy object is a powerful mechanism that allows you to intercept and customize fundamental operations on another object, known as the target object.

To create a Proxy, you need two components:

Target Object: The original object you want to proxy.
Handler Object: An object containing methods (traps) that define custom behavior for different operations on the target object.
