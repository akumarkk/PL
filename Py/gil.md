###### GIL

For CPU-bound tasks, this can significantly limit the performance benefits of using multiple threads.

 In such cases, the GIL can become a bottleneck, as the threads will have to take turns executing, effectively serializing the CPU-intensive work. 

GIL (Global Interpreter Lock):
In CPython, the standard implementation of Python, the GIL prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously. This means that while threads can improve performance for I/O-bound tasks, they may not be as effective for CPU-bound tasks that require heavy computation.
Synchronization:
If multiple threads access shared data, you need to use synchronization mechanisms like locks or semaphores to prevent data corruption or race conditions.
Alternatives:
multiprocessing:
If you need true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks, consider using the multiprocessing module, which creates separate processes that can run on multiple cores.
asyncio:
For asynchronous programming, the asyncio library provides a way to write concurrent code that is often more efficient and easier to read than traditional threading.
